        Vision Forge is a simple, fan-made space where you can find character
        builds, materials, and team compositions for Genshin Impact. My goal is
        to cut through the complexity and help you forge your perfect character.

        This isn't a pro-level guide; there are many ways to min-max builds. The
        recommendations here are based on common strategies and general best
        practices. Feel free to experiment and find what works best for your
        playstyle. There are also links to alternative guides that can help you
        with min-maxing.
